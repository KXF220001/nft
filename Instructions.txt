About this Project:

1. Dashboard will show the nft owned by the customer.
2. Buy NFT does not have balance validation but have value validation.
3. Once you buy with Name and TokenId, the NFT will be shown in the dashboard. That particular NFT will not be shown in the Buy NFT Page.
4. In NFT Table: is_avl is the NFT that are available(1-> available, 0-> not available).

BUGS

1. Currently we are updating the NFT_Owned table login_id(lid) column with hardcoded 1. Have to fix this to automatically store the login_id of the customer.
